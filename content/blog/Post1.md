title: Baby steps

I may be taking baby steps with this analysis since R is new to me.  But I also have the issue of not having any deadlines…yup I am that person.  On the plus side, I am not new to analysis or languages.

I learned SAS in graduate school - mainly to create time series models of economic data.  And it was probably that skill that help me land my first job, building financial models and analysis for US Banks.  Later I learned SQL to extract data from a variety of software so I could add more data to my models and analysis.  I eventually left the corporate world to do my own thing, strangely, it didn’t involve data modeling.  Of course, I soon realized how much I like data and analysis.  After a little bit of research, I found R.  The R Community has been amazing, and such pleasant discovery.  

I am not sure why I picked this journey…it seems to involve a lot of writing.  Have I mentioned that I am not a writer, I even did an oral defense for my Masters instead of a written thesis - maybe since I can usually BS my way through a lot.  If I keep creating word clouds, will that make me a writer?
